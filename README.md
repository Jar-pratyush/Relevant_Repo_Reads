## 1. Beginning With Git/GitHub

*Comprehensive overview of basic Git/GitHub commands to get you started.*

- [Oh My Git](http://ohmygit.org)
- [Agripongit](http://agripongit.vincenttunru.com)
- [Git & GitHub for Beginners (YouTube)](http://youtube.com/watch?v=apGV9Kg7ics&list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ&index=4)

## 2. Data Structures and Algorithms

*All-in-one resources for DSA that I personally recommend.*

### a. Kunal Kushwaha's Resources

- [DSA & Basic to Medium Algo Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ)  
  > Note: This playlist was never completed but sets a strong foundation.
- [DSA Bootcamp Java (Syllabus & Codes)](https://github.com/kunal-kushwaha/DSA-Bootcamp-Java)

### b. Striver Sheets

> The Striver approach: learn first, then solve. Don’t just memorize solutions.

- [Striver A2Z Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2)
- [Striver Blind 75](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/blind-75-leetcode-problems-detailed-video-solutions)
- [Striver SDE Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems)
- [Striver 79 Sheet (Last Moment Sheet)](https://takeuforward.org/interview-sheets/strivers-79-last-moment-dsa-sheet-ace-interviews)
- [Striver CP Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interview-experience/strivers-cp-sheet)

### c. Striver's YouTube Channel

> Not my top pick for learning, but excellent for understanding stepwise approaches: brute force → better → optimal.

- [Striver's Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgUwDviBIf0oF6QL8m22w1hIDC1vJ_BHz)

### d. LeetCode

**My LeetCode strategy:**

- Solve the daily problem if you understand the topics involved. If not, skip and revisit after learning.
- **Time Management:**
  - EASY: Max 30 mins
  - MEDIUM: Max 1h 30 mins
  - HARD: Max 1 day

> Most interviews focus on EASY and MEDIUM questions. HARD is for practice or leisure.

### e. Books

**My go-to books for DSA:**

| Book Title                                   | Author(s)                                | Notes                                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS)             | Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein         | Must-read for deep understanding                         |
| Algorithms Illuminated (Parts 1-3)            | Tim Roughgarden                          | Skip Part 4 unless doing competitive programming         |
| Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy      | Narasimha Karunmanchi                    | Practical and concise                                    |

> You don’t need to read all books cover-to-cover; I’ll update recommendations per topic.

### f. Repositories

**Highly recommended DSA-related repos:**

- [Test Cases and Data Sets for Programming Projects](https://github.com/beaunus/stanford-algs)  
  Great for real-world simulation projects needing diverse data sets.

- [The Complete FAANG Preparation](https://github.com/AkashSingh3031/The-Complete-FAANG-Preparation)  
  Comprehensive overview of FAANG/MAANG interview patterns.
