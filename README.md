# Relevant_Repo_Reads

This repository contains a collection of **useful repositories and resources** that I use daily for AI Engineering, Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), Development, MLOps, and DevOps.

## 1. Beginning With Git/GitHub

*Comprehensive overview of basic Git/GitHub commands to get you started.*

- [Oh My Git](http://ohmygit.org)
- [Agripongit](http://agripongit.vincenttunru.com)
- [Git & GitHub for Beginners (YouTube)](http://youtube.com/watch?v=apGV9Kg7ics&list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ&index=4)

## 2. Data Structures and Algorithms

*All-in-one resources for Data Structures and Algorithms which I personally prefer.*

### a. Kunal Kushwaha's Resources

- [DSA & Basic to Medium Algo Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ)  
  *Note: This playlist was never completed but sets a strong foundation.*
- [DSA Bootcamp Java (Syllabus & Codes)](https://github.com/kunal-kushwaha/DSA-Bootcamp-Java)

### b. Striver Sheets

*The approach to solving Striver sheets is simple yet elegant: learn first, then solve. Don’t blindly jump into questions or try to memorize them.*

- [Striver A2Z Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2)
- [Striver Blind 75](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/blind-75-leetcode-problems-detailed-video-solutions)
- [Striver SDE Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems)
- [Striver 79 Sheet (Last Moment Sheet)](https://takeuforward.org/interview-sheets/strivers-79-last-moment-dsa-sheet-ace-interviews)
- [Striver CP Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interview-experience/strivers-cp-sheet)

### c. Striver's YouTube Channel

*Not a great learning resource in my opinion, but definitely amazing for understanding level-wise approaches: starting with brute force, then better, and finally the most optimal solutions.*

## 3. LeetCode

**There is no one way to solve LeetCode, but here’s what works for me:**

- Always solve the daily problem if you have read and understood the topics involved. If you have no idea about the topic, skip the question for now.
- **Time Distribution Based on Question Difficulty:**
  - **EASY:** Max 30 mins thinking time
  - **MEDIUM:** Max 1h 30 mins thinking time
  - **HARD:** Max 1 day thinking time

> Most commonly, only EASY to MEDIUM level questions are seen in interviews. HARD questions are for leisure/off-hand problem solving.
