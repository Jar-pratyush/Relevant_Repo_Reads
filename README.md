  e. **LEETCODE :**
  (There is no one way to solve leetcode but i'll layout what works for me)
----
  1. Always solve the daily problem if you have read and understood the topics involved in it. If you have no idea about the topic don't touch the question for now.
  2. Time Distribution based on question difficulty :
     EASY - Thinking time : Max of 30 mins
     MED  - Thinking time : Max of 1h 30 mins
     HARD - Thinking time : Max of 1 day
(Most commonly only the Questions from EASY to MED level's are seen in interviews, HARD questions are like leisure time off hand problem solving)
